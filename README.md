# Soil-food-web-flux-and-stability-functions-MATLAB
This repository contains the MATLAB functions I created for my master thesis. Functions can be used to compute carbon and nitrogen fluxes for a soil food web as published by De Ruiter et al. (1993). Subsequently the staiblity function can be used to compute stability as published by De Ruiter et al. (2015).
